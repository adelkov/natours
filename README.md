## Natours
I created this project coding along [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) course on Udemy.

The site is deployed at [http://ill-fated-rabbits.surge.sh/](http://ill-fated-rabbits.surge.sh/)

### Things I practiced:

 - Build a custom grid system
 - BEM model
 - SCSS architecture: the 1|7 rule
 - Positioning, centering
 - Animations: simple animations and the @keyframe
 - Responsive design (desktop first)
 - Sass: mixins, variables, nesting, architecture
 - Handling background videos
 - Pseudo classes and the checkbox 'trick'
